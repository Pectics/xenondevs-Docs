## Adding compatibility with ItemsAdder

To make ItemsAdder and Nova work together, you need to follow these steps:

1. Change the following values in ItemsAdder's `config.yml`:
    - Set `resource-pack` > `hosting` > `no-host` > `enabled` to `true` (all other options under `hosting` must be `false`).
    - Under `resource-pack` > `zip` > `protect-file-from-unzip` set both `protection_1` and `protection_2` to `false`.
    - Set `resource-pack` > `zip` > `disable-overwrite-leather-armor-layers-textures` to `true`.
2. Add the ItemsAdder resource pack zip file as a [base pack](../setup.md#optional-resourcepack-merging) in Nova's main config.
3. Regenerate Nova's resource pack with `/nova resourcePack create` (make sure that you've run `/iazip` before and the resource pack zip exists)

!!! warning "Unsupported Features"

    ItemsAdder's recolored armor _"mineral armor"_ is not supported. Please use custom textures.

## Adding new assets to ItemsAdder

After adding new assets to ItemsAdder and running `/iazip`, you will now also need to run `/nova resourcePack create`.
