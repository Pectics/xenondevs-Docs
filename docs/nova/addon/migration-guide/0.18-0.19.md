## InvUI

Updated InvUI to 2.0.0-alpha.8, which contains numerous breaking changes.
See the [InvUI GitHub release page](https://github.com/NichtStudioCode/InvUI/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha.8)
for details.

## ItemBehavior

- `#!kotlin ItemBehavior.defaultPatch` has been removed with no replacement
- `#!kotlin ItemBehavior.baseDataComponents` is now a provider of `xyz.xenondevs.nova.world.item.DataComponentMap`
 instead of the nms `DataComponentMap`. The new `DataComponentMap` allows the usage of Paper's data component types.
 Use the top-level function `buildDataComponentMapProvider { }` for a builder DSL.
- `#!kotlin ItemBehavior#handleEquip` has been updated to use Paper's `EntityEquipmentChangedEvent`.
 Note that this handler is fired more often than the old one, such as when joining the server or when equipping
 an item in a hand. Nova's custom `ArmorEquipEvent` has been removed.
- Removed overloads for default item behavior factory functions (and updated their constructors) that
 accepted `Holder<SoundEvent>`. Use `Key` instead.
