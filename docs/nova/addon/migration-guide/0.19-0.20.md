## Minecraft version

Updated to 1.21.8

## ItemBehavior

- `modifyClientSideStack` now receives the server-side `ItemStack` instead of `data: NamespacedCompound`. 
   The data can still be accessed by using the `ItemStack.retrieveData` extension functions on `server: ItemStack`.

## commons-provider

Updated to `2.0.0-alpha.4`, which contains the following breaking changes:

- Removed `MutableProvider.defaultsTo`, use `orElse` instead. (For CBF compounds, entry providers can now have a default value)
- Removed `MutableProvider.orElse(Provider)` with no replacement
- Removed `MutableProvider.detached` with no replacement
- Some extension functions, such as `map` and `flatMap`, are now member functions on `Provider` / `MutableProvider`, which
  means that you may need to remove some invalid imports.

## CBF

Updated to `1.0.0-alpha.2`, which contains major changes to how custom serializers work.  
Check out the updated [CBF Docs](../../../../../cbf) and [CBF KDocs](https://cbf.dokka.xenondevs.xyz).

## InvUI

Updated to `2.0.0-alpha.14`, which contains one breaking change:

- Removed `Gui#remove(...)` in favor of `Gui#setSlotElement(..., null)`
