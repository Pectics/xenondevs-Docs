??? question "What Minecraft versions does InvUI v2 support?"
    Starting with v2.0.0, InvUI no longer supports multiple Minecraft versions. Instead, new InvUI versions will always only target the latest Minecraft version. You can find a table mapping InvUI versions to Minecraft versions in the [GitHub readme](https://github.com/NichtStudioCode/InvUI/tree/ver/2.x?tab=readme-ov-file#version-compatibility).

??? question "Will InvUI v1 continue receiving updates after v2 is released?"
    No, InvUI v1 will not receive any further updates after the release of v2. If you require multi-version support, you may want to consider switching to a different library. A list of alternatives can be found [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/creating-a-gui-inventory/#libraries).
